# Documentation

The Hype Sticky Scroll extension allows you to create a sticky scroll effect in your Tumult Hype projects. The extension provides an easy way to control the scroll progress and switch between scenes within a Hype document.

## Getting Started

Include the Hype Sticky Scroll script in the head of your HTML document either through the resources library or using a CDN.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I enable the sticky scroll effect?**

A: You can enable the sticky scroll effect by calling the `enableStickyScroll` function on the Hype document object like this:

```javascript
hypeDocument.enableStickyScroll(height);
```

Replace `height` with your desired height value in pixels.

**Q: How do I disable the sticky scroll effect?**

A: You can disable the sticky scroll effect by calling the `disableStickyScroll` function on the Hype document object like this:

```javascript
hypeDocument.disableStickyScroll();
```

**Q: How do I exclude certain scenes from the sticky scroll calculation?**

A: To exclude specific scenes from the sticky scroll effect, simply include the ðŸ”’ symbol in the scene's name. This tells the Hype Sticky Scroll extension to ignore that scene when calculating the total length of the scroll effect.

**Q: How can I get the current scroll progress?**

A: You can get the current scroll progress by calling the `getProgress` function on the Hype document object like this:

```javascript
hypeDocument.getProgress();
```

This function returns a value between 0 and 1, representing the scroll progress.

**Q: How can I scroll to the start of a scene?**

A: You can scroll to the start of a scene by calling the `scrollToSceneStart` function on the Hype document object like this:

```javascript
hypeDocument.scrollToSceneStart(sceneName, duration, easing);
```

Replace `sceneName` with the name of the scene you want to scroll to, `duration` with the desired scroll duration in milliseconds (use 0 for instant scrolling), and `easing` with the desired easing function ('linear', 'in', 'out', 'inout').
